   Welcome to Abbrevia</H1>
  <P>
   Abbrevia is a set of components that allows you to add file archiving 
   and data compression to your applications. Using Abbrevia, your 
   application can organize data (by grouping files into an archive) and 
   save disk space (by compressing the data).</P>
  <P>
   The components in Abbrevia implement PKZIP-compatible, TAR, GZip, and 
   (on Windows) Microsoft CAB file format data compression and 
   archiving. PKZIP (the originator of .ZIP files) is a widely used tool 
   for data compression and file archival, developed by Phil Katz of 
   PKWare, Inc. PKZIP is distributed via shareware and commercial 
   channels. The PKZIP file formats and algorithms are published by PKWare.</P>
  <P>
   TAR and GZip are well known tools on the Linux platform for creating 
   compressed collections of files. TAR (an acronym for Tape ARchive) is 
   a method for concatenating a number of files into a single large 
   file. It was originally used for backing up files to tape storage, 
   hence the name.</P>
  <P>
   GZip is a format for compressing data using a method similar to that 
   of PKZIP. Unlike Zip, however, the GZip format does not handle 
   enclosing multiple files well, so the nearly universal practice is 
   use TAR to make a collection of the set of files and then GZip the 
   resulting &quot;TARBall&quot; to compress it.</P>
  <P>
   Abbrevia provides routines and components that can handle TAR 
   Archives, GZips containing a single file, and the common combination 
   of a GZipped TAR.</P>
  <P>
   The <A HREF="ch4b1hx0.htm">TAbBaseComponent class</A> is the ancestor 
   of most of the Abbrevia components. It is descended from the VCL 
   TComponent class and adds the Version property that identifies the 
   current version.</P>
  <P>
   The <A HREF="ch4b8coi.htm">TAbBaseBrowser class</A> is the ancestor 
   to all of the Abbrevia non-visual components, both the zip archive 
   components, and the cabinet archive components. The TAbBrowser 
   provides the common functionality and references an abstract 
   TAbArchive class.</P>
  <P>
   The Abbrevia cabinet components implement <A HREF="ch107k2t.htm">CAB 
   file format data compression</A> and archiving via the Microsoft 
   CABINET.DLL. The Microsoft CABINET.DLL is a system DLL that is 
   installed with 32-bit versions of Microsoft Windows. Cab files can be 
   created using MSZip or LZX compression, or simply stored.</P>
  <P>
   Abbrevia provides automatic disk spanning compatible with that 
   performed by PKZIP. When an archive fills a removable disk or reaches 
   a configurable threshold size, Abbrevia automatically prompts for 
   another disk. Abbrevia can also extract files from spanned disk 
   archives. (Note: On Linux this functionality is subject to proper 
   floppy drive mount and unmount permissions, and the floppy file 
   system should be mounted as a DOS Compatible FAT format of some type.)</P>
  <P>
   The <A HREF="ch5n7zci.htm">TAbZipBrowser component</A> is a 
   non-visual component that allows read-only access to a 
   PKZIP-compatible archive. It does not include support for inserting 
   or extracting files in the archive.</P>
  <P>
   <A HREF="ch5n0h0y.htm">TAbUnZipper</A> is a non-visual component that 
   extends the capabilities of the TAbZipBrowser by adding the ability 
   to extract files from an archive.</P>
  <P>
   <A HREF="ch5n3fle.htm">TAbZipper</A> is a non-visual component that 
   extends the capabilities of the TAbZipBrowser by adding the ability 
   to add, freshen, or move files in an archive.</P>
  <P>
   <A HREF="ch5n2zzo.htm">TAbZipKit</A> is a non-visual component that 
   gives you everything&#151;with it you can browse an archive, add 
   files, and extract files. It combines the abilities of TAbUnzipper 
   and TAbZipper. TAbZipKit is derived from TAbCustomZipper, and adds 
   all the functionality of the TAbUnZipper.</P>
  <P>
   <A HREF="6cab4p4i.htm">TAbCabBrowser</A> is a non-visual component 
   that provides read-only access to a cabinet archive. It does not 
   include support for building a cabinet or extracting files from a cabinet.</P>
  <P>

   that extends the capabilities of the TAbCabBrowser by adding the 
   ability to extract files from a cabinet archive.</P>
  <P>
   <A HREF="6cab8882.htm">TAbMakeCab</A> is a non-visual component that 
   extends the capabilities of the TAbCabBrowser by adding the ability 
   to create a cabinet archive and add files to it.</P>
  <P>
   <A HREF="6cab59ro.htm">TAbCabKit</A> is a non-visual component that 
   extends the capabilities of the TAbMakeCab by adding the ability to 
   open an existing cabinet archive and extract files from it.</P>
  <P>
   The <A HREF="ch7z4qg5.htm">TAbZipOutline</A> component is a visual 
   component that allows read/write access to a PKZIP-compatible file, 
   including full support for adding and extracting files.</P>
  <P>

   display of a PKZIP, GZip, Tar, or Gzipped Tar compatible archive.</P>
  <P>
   <A HREF="ch8z95iv.htm">The TAbCabView component</A> provides a grid 
   display of a cabinet archive. Simply attach it to a non- visual 
   Abbrevia cabinet component via the CabComponent property. The 
   TAbCabView component will display the current contents of a cabinet 
   archive and keeps its display updated automatically with any 
   additions to the archive.</P>
  <P>
   <A HREF="9com7w4l.htm">The TAbCompoundFile class</A> introduced in 
   Abbrevia 3 provides the user the ability to store multiple, 
   compressed files as part of a single file. This functionality 
   emulates the functionality of Microsoft&#146;s Structured Storage 
   mechanism, but does not rely on COM interfaces to achieve this 
   functionality. Abbrevia&#146;s compound file class encapsulates a 
   miniature file system within the single compound file. The mechanism 
   employed to achieve this end result is similar to the FAT file system.</P>
