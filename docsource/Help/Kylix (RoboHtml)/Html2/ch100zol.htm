   Default: '' (Windows); Current User's UserName (Linux)</P>
  <P>
   Indicates the Unix file system &quot;User Name&quot; for the archived 
   file.The standard Unix file system (which is also used by Linux) 
   includes the notion of a particular user to which a file belongs. 
   Users may be identified both by number and by a symbolic name (e.g. 
   &quot;NWIRTH&quot; might be the username for a person named 
   &quot;Niklaus Wirth&quot;). The UserName property supplies this value 
   for a Tar item.</P>
  <P>
   When extracting files on Windows this value is provided, but is 
   otherwise ignored. On Linux the UserID property is used to determine 
   the user that the extracted file is assigned to. Abbrevia does not 
   ensure that the stored UserID and UserName match according to the 
   file system.</P>
  <P>
   When compressing files, changing this value from the default causes 
   the value to be stored with the file as the User Name, but has no 
   other effect on the archiving process. In particular, Abbrevia does 
   not ensure that the value set to UserName corresponds to that 
   associated with the UserID property according to the Linux file 
   system. The programmer has the option and opportunity to perform such 
   checks in the OnProcessItem event of a TAbArchive descendant.</P>
