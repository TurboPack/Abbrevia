  <P>
   The TAbMakeSelfExe component provides a mechanism that simplifies the 
   process of building a self-extracting zip archive.</P>
  <P>
   A self-extracting archive is an executable file that, when executed, 
   will extract files contained within itself. You can use a 
   self-extracting archive when you need to distribute an archive to 
   someone who doesn't have the tools to extract files from a 
   PKZIP-compatible archive. Abbrevia's components operate on 
   self-extracting archives just as if they were standard PKZIP archives.</P>
  <P>
   The TAbMakeSelfExe component adds an existing zip archive file to an 
   existing executable stub file and modifies references within the 
   archive, resulting in a self-extracting zip archive file. The process 
   is to first create a self-extracting stub and then attach an archive 
   to it. Since you can build your own self-extracting stubs with 
   Abbrevia, you control what happens when the self-extracting archive 
   is run. A simple stub project called SelfStub is included with the 
   Abbrevia source files.
