   Simple Stream Compression Routines</H1>

  <P>
   Abbrevia includes two routines (DeflateStream defined in the AbZipPrc 
   unit, and InflateStream defined in the AbUnzPrc unit) that allow 
   low-level compression and decompression of data using streams. 
   Because no directory information is stored, PKZIP and the other 
   Abbrevia components cannot use the data created by these routines. 
   Therefore, these routines should always be used as a pair.</P>
  <P>
   The stream compression routines are ideal for compressing 
   application-specific data. The stream data can be compressed 
   directly, without involving any files.</P>
  <P>
   <B>Note:</B> The DeflateStream and InflateStream are kept for 
   backward compatibility with previous versions of Abbrevia; internally 
   they just call the Deflate and Inflate routines described in the 
   previous section. New code should use those routines instead.</P>
  <P>
   The Strmpad example project in the Abbrevia examples directory 
   illustrates how these routines can be used.
