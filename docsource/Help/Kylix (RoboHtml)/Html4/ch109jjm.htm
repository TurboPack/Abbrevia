   Provides the &quot;Major Device ID&quot; from the Unix file system.</P>
  <P>
   The standard Unix file system (which is also used by Linux) includes 
   the notion that storage devices have identification numbers. This 
   consists of two parts: the Major ID and the Minor ID.</P>
  <P>
   On some Unix implementations it's important to know the device (or 
   class of device) that created the archive, and so the Tar data 
   includes information related to that. Modern Unix implementations 
   (including Linux) generally seem to ignore this fields but, it is 
   provided for backward compatibility.</P>
  <P>
   When extracting files from a Tar, Abbrevia ignores this value.</P>
  <P>
   If you set this property, the value will be stored with the Tar item, 
   but it has no other effect on the archiving process.</P>
