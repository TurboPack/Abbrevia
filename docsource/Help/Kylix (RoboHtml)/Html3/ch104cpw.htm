   The maximum cabinet folder (compression block) size.</P>
  <P>
   Items in a cabinet archive can be compressed across their file 
   boundaries as a single compression block. Such compression blocks are 
   called folders. Compression ratios improve significantly when items 
   are compressed together as opposed to individually. However, there is 
   a trade-off between random access time to an individual item and 
   compression ratio since an entire folder must be decompressed to 
   extract an item from it.</P>
  <P>
   Use FolderThreshold to specify the maximum size of a folder 
   (compression block). When compressing files, this value will be used 
   to determine when to stop the current compression block and start a 
   new one. You can also start a new folder by calling NewFolder.</P>
