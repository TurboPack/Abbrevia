1. Introduction


Abbrevia is a compression toolkit for Delphi and C++Builder.
It supports compressing and decompressing PKZIP, Microsoft CAB, tar, gzip, and 
bzip2 archives, and can create self-extracting executables. On Windows it also 
provides Delphi wrappers for the LZMA, Bzip2, and WavPack SDKs, and PPMd decompression.

Abbrevia also has several visual controls that simplify displaying and manipulating 
archives, including treeview and listview components.

This is a source-only release of TurboPack Abbrevia. It includes
designtime and runtime packages for Delphi and C++Builder and supports 
Win32, Win64, OSX, iOS, Linux, and Android.
