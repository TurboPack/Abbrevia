{NOTE: ABDEFINE.INC is included in all ABBREVIA units; hence you can
       specify global compiler options here. ABDEFINE.INC is included
       *before* each unit's own required compiler options, so options
       specified here could be overridden by hardcoded options in the
       unit source file.}


{====Compiler options that can be changed====}
{$A+ Force alignment on word/dword boundaries}
{$S- No stack checking}

{---Global compiler defines for 32-bit OS's---}
{====Global fixed compiler options (do NOT change)====}

{$B- Incomplete boolean evaluation}
{$H+ Long string support}
{$P- No open string parameters}
{$Q- Arithmetic overflow checking} {!! - Needs to be turned on!}
{$R- Range checking}               {!! - Needs to be turned on!}
{$T+ No type-checked pointers}
{$V- No var string checking}
{$X+ Extended syntax}
{$Z1 Enumerations are byte sized}

 According to
    http://www.gzip.org/zlib/rfc1952.txt

 A compliant gzip compressor should calculate and set the CRC32 and ISIZE.
 However, a compliant decompressor should not check these values.

 If you want to check the the values of the CRC32 and ISIZE in a GZIP file
 when decompressing enable the STRICTGZIP define below. }

{ The following define is ONLY used for Abbrevia Unit Tests.
  It has no effect on the Abbrevia Library.
